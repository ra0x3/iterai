- We write "Open source code" here, not "Enterprise code"
- Open source code is more cool, laid back, simple -- clever, whereas enterprise code is long and boring and awful to look at
- For Python, our inspiration on how we write Python should come from the "requests" Python library source code -- this includes comments as well
- Don't ever add code comments without being explicitly asked to do so
- Don't use magic strings for things that should be enums
- We prefer SOLID coding principles where possible
